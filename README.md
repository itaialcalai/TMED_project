# README - Bioinformatics Study on TMED9
## Overview
This repository contains the full collection of tools, scripts, and data used in our bioinformatics study on the role of TMED9 across various diseases, particularly its implication in Mucin 1 Kidney Disease (MKD) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The repository serves as a comprehensive technical archive, encompassing all the tools and outputs used at various stages of our research.

## Disclaimer:
This codebase is not meant to run as a unified program. It contains a plethora of tools and scripts utilized during different research phases. The code is provided for transparency, traceability, and possible future investigations.

## Structure:
1. outputs:
Contains generated TSV files.
PDF and PNG files for various plots generated during the research.
2. text files:
Contains text files with configurations, and ouputs.
3. R_scripts:
Houses all the R scripts utilized in various phases of the project.
4. python_scripts:
Contains Python programs developed for project-specific needs.
5. pdf:
For extensive PDF documents relevant to the project.
6. docx:
Word documents with reports and other pertinent details.
...and more.
## Key Note:
While the repository contains a vast array of tools, files, and outputs, not all of them were integrated into the final report. This repository, thus, also serves as an extended library of dependencies for the research report.

## About the Research:
Our study ventured into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repositories to comprehend TMED9's implications across diseases, especially those marked by protein misfolding. The research utilized extensive statistical analyses backed by tools in R and Python and supplemented with visual representations. Our primary focus, beyond MKD, was on Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). You can refer to the provided final report document for a detailed insight.

## Important Note on Project Evolution:
Towards the end of our research, GEO introduced a feature called GEO2R, which greatly reduces the need for many of the tools we developed. This, in essence, diminished the necessity to convert our tools into a full-fledged software solution. As such, while our tools and scripts retain their academic and investigative value, their practical application has been superseded by GEO2R.
